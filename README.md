# CREATIVE --- Face_Url_Scraper_2022

Welcome! This repo contains scripts for collecting and organizing face images of political figures for the 2022 US election cycle. The scripts can be used to create a comprehensive dataset of face images.

This repo is a part of the [Cross-platform Election Advertising Transparency Initiative (CREATIVE)](https://www.creativewmp.com/). CREATIVE has the goal of providing the public with analysis tools for more transparency of political ads across online platforms. In particular, CREATIVE provides cross-platform integration and standardization of political ads collected from Google and Facebook. CREATIVE is a joint project of the [Wesleyan Media Project (WMP)](https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/) and the [privacy-tech-lab](https://privacytechlab.org/) at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu).

To analyze the different dimensions of political ad transparency we have developed an analysis pipeline. The scripts in this repo are part of the Data Collection step in our pipeline.

## 2. Overview

This repo contains scripts for collecting and organizing face images of political figures for the 2022 US election cycle. It also contains a dataset ready for your use.

1. The repo contains scripts that scrape and organize face images from various online sources in a hierarchical manner. The primary sources are:

   - Ballotpedia
   - Wikipedia
   - Persons' facebook pages
   - Candidate campaign websites

   If a suitable face image cannot be found from these primary sources, then we attempt to scrape a face image from VoteSmart as a fallback option since face images from VoteSmart are often not ideal in size (low resolution) for face recognition purposes. The VoteSmart scraper is located in a separate folder `/votesmart`.

   The scraper collects the face images via different categories based on the political figures' roles, such as legislative (House and Senate candidates, sitting Senators), executive (presidents, cabinet members, governors), judicial (Supreme Court Justices), and other prominent persons. You can find more detailed description of face categories in the [Face categories](#face-categories) section.

   The scrapers are named per their sources and categories. For example, a scraper that collects senators' face images via Ballotpedia is called `01_ballotpedia_scaper_senate.ipynb`. The script that is organizing (i.e., cleaning up) senators' scraped results from Ballotpedia is called `01_ballotpedia_scaper_senate_cleanup.ipynb`. The data produced by each script is stored in the `data` folder.

2. After collecting face images from a source a final face image quality control and assemble stage is performed via `07_face_url_final_assemble.ipynb` and `08_face_url_final_selection.ipynb`. During this stage, a few additional face images may be manually used from other websites to ensure the best possible quality and consistency across the dataset. After the quality control all the collected and organized face images urls are combined into a single csv file: `result_face_url_2022.csv` via the `08_face_url_final_selection.ipynb` script.

### Results

Here is a summary of the final face image collection dataset:

- [1,650 unique wmpids](https://github.com/Wesleyan-Media-Project/face_url_scraper_2022/blob/main/result_face_url_2022.csv) (face image ids) for the 2022 face collection
- Among them, 94 wmpids do not have face images

The final output contains the following fields:

- **wmpid**: unique id for each political figure
- **full_name**: full name of the political figure
- **face_url_2022**: the url of the face image
- **face_category_2022**: the category of the political figure

An example of a line in the final output is shown below:
| wmpid | full_name | face_url_2022 | face_category_2022 |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WMPID1000 | Josh Gottheimer | <https://s3.amazonaws.com/ballotpedia-api4/files/thumbs/200/300/Josh_Gottheimer.jpg> | House |

## 3. Setup

First, make sure you have the [datasets](https://github.com/Wesleyan-Media-Project/datasets) repo cloned.

Then, you need to install the following libraries in R:

    - tidyverse
    - rvest
    - httr
    - xml2

Next, install the following packages for Python:

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - bs4
    - urllib
    - re
    - fuzzywuzzy

After you have installed the required libraries, you can now run the code follow the order of the numbers in the file names (e.g., you can start with: `01_ballotpedia_scaper_senate_cleanup.ipynb`, then `01_ballotpedia_scaper_senate.ipynb`, then `02_ballotpedia_scaper_house_cleanup.ipynb` ... `08_face_url_final_selection.ipynb`).

**Note**: When re-running this script, face images will be replaced with current office holders on relevant official websites.
